## Clock V Scheme - designed for ENIGMA (An Information Security Competition)

### Overview of the Scheme:
The code defines a function encrypt_decrypt that takes a plaintext and keys (k1 to k5) as input and performs encryption or decryption based on user choice. The encryption process involves dividing the plaintext into chunks of 4 characters, mapping characters to their corresponding integer values, and applying the specified operations for each character in the chunk. The main program takes user input for encryption or decryption, keys, and plaintext or ciphertext.
